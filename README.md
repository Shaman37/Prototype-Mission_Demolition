# Prototype-Mission_Demolition

This project is a Unity Example Game from the book [Introduction to Game Design, Prototyping, and Development, 2nd Edition](https://book.prototools.net/), by Jeremy Gibson Bond.

It is a physics-based casual game prototype, inspired by games such as [Angry birds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angry_Birds), [Worms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worms_(series)), 
[Crossbows and Catapults](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossbows_and_Catapults), [Scorched Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scorched_Earth_(video_game)), and so on.

You can play it [here!](https://shaman37.itch.io/prototype-mission-demolition)
## How to play

Hovering your mouse over the slingshot will make it glow. This means you can now hold down the _left mouse button_ and drag it around to fire a projectile agains the castle on the other end of the map.

A player can also change their perspective of the game by click the button on top. <br />
The available perspectives are as follows: 
- Show Slingshot -> Zooms in tho only show slingshot on the screen;
- Show Castle -> Zooms in tho only show the castle on the screen;
- Show Both -> Zooms out and shows both the slingshot and the castle on the screen;

The goal is to break the castle down to have the projectil reach the _goal zone_, visible in green.

The prototype has 4 levels to play through.
